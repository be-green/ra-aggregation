# ra-aggregation

This repo is dedicated to scraping and aggregating various econ RA jobs from the internet, centralizing them in [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10XhdH0F84g5AyjXS6_Yru6Nw94RAk7Vsepov2ejMpNE/edit). Right now it grabs them from NBER and the @econ_ra twitter account. 

# Requirements

It's quite ugly code right now, but if you want to run something like this yourself you will need:

* A twitter developer account for api requests
* R, the language
* Various and sundry R packages (rvest, data.table, tweetr, googlesheets, magrittr, stringr)
